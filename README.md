The compiler converts expressions into code which can be used in a stack machine (Polish notation).

To use (in Mac/Linux):
1) Run makefile using make to get compiler
2) Use ./bin/e++ a.txt to compile set of e++ expressions for file a.txt in parent directory
3) You get a filename called targ.txt which contains the expression for stack machine code
